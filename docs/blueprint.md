## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to evoke a sense of adventure and trust. 
- Background color: Light, desaturated blue (#E0F7FA) for a clean and airy feel.
- Accent color: Analogous teal (#29E2BB) to create highlights and call to action.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) blends a modern look with warmth, making it ideal for a travel app, because long sections of text are expected.
- Use detailed, visually appealing icons to represent activities, food, and transportation options.
- Employ a clean and intuitive layout with clear section headings and easy-to-read formatting for itineraries.
- Subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience when navigating through the itinerary and viewing details.
